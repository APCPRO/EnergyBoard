# X2Bus Energy Board
  
##MAX78630
**Description**  
The MAX78630+PPM is an energy measurement processor for polyphase power-monitoring systems. It is designed for real-time monitoring for a variety of typical three-phase configurations in industrial applications. The MAX78630+PPM provides up to six analog inputs for interfacing to voltage and current sensors. Scaled voltages from the sensors are fed to the single converter front-end using a high-resolution delta-sigma converter. Supported current sensors include current transformers (CTs), Rogowski coils, and resistive shunts.  
  
In this Arduino Library we can read all data of energy parameters.
