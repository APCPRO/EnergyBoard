{"name":"X2Bus Energyboard","tagline":"X2Bus Energy Board - is an poly phase energy measurement development board.","body":"### X2Bus Energy Board\r\n  \r\n**Description**  \r\nThe MAX78630+PPM is an energy measurement processor for polyphase power-monitoring systems. It is designed for real-time monitoring for a variety of typical three-phase configurations in industrial applications. The MAX78630+PPM provides up to six analog inputs for interfacing to voltage and current sensors. Scaled voltages from the sensors are fed to the single converter front-end using a high-resolution delta-sigma converter. Supported current sensors include current transformers (CTs), Rogowski coils, and resistive shunts.  \r\n  \r\nIn this Arduino Library we can read all data of energy parameters.\r\n***\r\n###Functions  \r\n  \r\n| Data Type | Function                    | Description                               |\r\n|-----------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\r\n| float     | Voltage(char phase);\t\t  |Â Read Voltage at selected phase            |\r\n| float     | Current(char phase);\t\t  | Read Current at selected phase            |\r\n| float     | ActivePower(char phase);\t  | Read Active Power at selected phase       |\r\n| float     | ReactivePower(char phase);  | Read Re Active Power at selected phase    |\r\n| float     | ApparentPower(char phase);  | Read Apparent Power at selected phase     |\r\n| float     | PowerFactor(char phase);\t  | Read Power Factor at selected phase       |\r\n| float     | Frequency(void);\t\t\t  | Read Frequency of system                  |\r\n\r\n***\r\n###License\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2015 @X2Bus\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
